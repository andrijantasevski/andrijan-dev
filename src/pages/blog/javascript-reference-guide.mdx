## Declaring variables

### let

To declare a variable whose value can be reassigned later, we use **let**:

```javascript
// Declare a variable
let firstName = "John";

// Reassign the value
firstName = "Mark";
```

### const

To declare a variable whose value **cannot** be reassigned later, we use **const**:

```javascript
// Declare a variable
const firstName = "John";

// Reassign the value
firstName = "Mark";
```
After writing the code above, we get the following **error**, implying that we have already declared a variable with the same name:

_Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'firstName' has already been declared_

To solve the problem, we need to change the name of the variable:

```javascript
// Valid declaration of variables with const
const firstName = "John";

const newFirstName = "Mark";
```

### var

When we declare a variable with var, it is added to the **global window object**, which means that we will be able to access the variable within any scope. For this reason, we should avoid using var and replace it with let and const.

However, we can declare a variable with var the following way:

```javascript
// Declare a variable
var firstName = "John";

// Reassign the value
firstName = "John";
```

## Initialization of variables

We cannot read or perform any operation on variables before they are declared. For example,

```javascript
console.log(firstName);

const firstName = "John";
```

If we do this, we would get the following error:

_Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'firstName' before initialization._

To fix it, we need to declare the variable first and then use it in console.log()

```javascript
const firstName = "John";

console.log(firstName);
```

_Functions, for example, can be accessed before they are declared. In fact, they can be accessed anywhere in the script. This is called HOISTING._


## Naming variables

We typically use **camel case** in JavaScript. This means that we write all the words together, where the first letter of the first word is small and all the subsequent first letters of each word are capitalized.

An example of camel-cased text would be **nameOfFile**.

### Rules for naming variables in JS

The name of the variable can consist of **numbers**, **text** or the symbols **\_** or **$**.

```javascript
const $hello2 = "Hello 2";
```

We **cannot** use a number at the **beginning** of a variable.

```javascript
// Incorrect
const 2hello = "Hello 2";

// Correct
const hello2 = "Hello 2";
```

Variables are **case sensitive**.

```javascript
// These are two different variables
const hello = "Hello";

const HELLO = "Hello";
```

We should stick to English when naming variables (and in programming in general), as everyone should be able to understand us. Using other languages will not cause any errors, but we should nonetheless stick to English.

### Reserved names for variables

Some words are reserved and cannot be used as names for variables because they are typically used for something else in JavaScript.

For example, **let, const, return, number, function** are reserved names among many others.

### Uppercase const(ants)

We typically use uppercase with constants for values that are difficult to remember and known prior to execution.

```javascript
// Prior to creating a quiz, we know that the maximum attempts are 4 and the maximum points are 100
const MAX_ATTEMPTS = 4;

const MAX_POINTS = 100;
```

> ðŸ’¡ Variables should be _concise_, _descriptive_ and written in _camelCase_

## Data types

The value of a variable always needs to be of a certain data type.

Data types in JavaScript can be **primitives** (primitive type) or **objects** (reference type).

**Primitive data types** in JavaScript are: **number**, **string**, **boolean**, **undefined**, **null**, **symbol**, **BigInt**.

**Objects** or **reference data types** are: **arrays**, **objects**, **functions**.

### Checking the type of data with JavaScript

To check the data type of the value of the variable, we can use **typeof**:

```javascript
const age = 24;

typeof age // The result returned should be "number"
```

## Text (strings)

A text string in JavaScript must always be wrapped in quotes/backticks.

We can use single or double quotes, we just need to be consistent in using them.

```javascript
// Both are correct. It is a matter of personal preference.
const firstName = "Andrijan";

const lastName = 'Tasevski';
```

### Nested quotes

We need to use single quotes when they are nested in double quotes and vice versa (double quotes, when they are nested in single quotes).

```html
<!-- In this HTML element, we need to use single quotes when they are nested in double quotes. And vice versa, we need to use double quotes if they are nested in single quotes. -->
<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')"></button>
```

### String concatenation

To concatenate (connect together) two or more strings together, we use the **+ operator**.

```javascript
const age = 25;

const Andrijan = "I am Andrijan and I am" + " " + age + " " + "years old";

console.log(Andrijan);
```

### Template literals

We can use backticks to declare **template literals**.

```javascript
// Text string with quotes
let textString = "Hello World!";

// Template literal
let templateLiteral = `Template Literal`;
```

Template literals are great because they offer extended functionality as opposed to regular text strings with quotes. Namely, we can include **variables** and **expressions** in our text strings. This means that we do not need to concatenate strings like before and use empty strings for spaces.

To include variables or expressions, we need to wrap them as in the example below:

```javascript
const firstName = "Andrijan";

const lastName = "Tasevski";

// We include variables and an expression (20 + 4)
const Andrijan = `I am ${firstName} ${Tasevski} and I am ${20 + 4} years old.`;

console.log(Andrijan);
```

### Converting different values to strings

To convert different values to strings, we use the **String() method**:

```javascript
// Converting a number to a string
let age = 25;

age = String(age); // Result should be "25"

// Converting a boolean to a string
let isLoggedIn = true;

isLoggedIn = String(isLoggedIn); // Result should be "true"

```

### Length of string

To get the length of a string, we use the property **length**:

```javascript
let name = "Ann";

console.log(name.length) // Result should be 3;

// If we add whitespace after the name that is also counted
name = "Ann "

console.log(name.length) // Result should be 4;
```

### Extracting part of a string

To extract part of a string, we can use the method **slice()**

Depending on the arguments we enter in the method, we get different results:

```javascript
slice() // We get a copy of the original string/array.

slice(start) // We tell the method from which position to extract the elements from the string/array. The end position is not specified, which means that all the elements till the end will be copied as well.

slice(start, end) // We tell the method from which position to extract the elements from the array and at which position it should end.
```

With actual examples:

```javascript
// Making a copy
let name = "Andrijan";

let newName = name.slice(); // We create a copy of the name variable. Whatever changes we make to the newName variable will not affect the original name one.

// Copying from position X without specifying the end
console.log(name.slice(1)) // Result should be "ndrijan"

// Copying from position X and specifying the end
console.log(name.slice(0, 5)) // Result should be "Andri"

// Copy from position -X
console.log(name.slice(-6)) // Result should be "drijan"
```

We can also use the **substring()** and **substr()** methods to achieve similar results. However, slice() is easier to work with.

> ðŸ’¡ Arrays and strings are zero-based, which means that we start counting from 0 and not 1. For example, in the string "Andrijan" - A is at position 0.

### Replacing part of a string

To replace a part of a string with some other text, we can use the method **replace()**.

```javascript
// The method takes two arguments: the pattern/item we want to replace and its replacement as the second argument
replace(pattern, replacement)

// Replace John with Jon in the variable name
let name = "John Doe";

let newName = name.replace("John", "Jon");

console.log(name, newName) // Result should be "John Doe" "Jon Doe"
```

> ðŸ’¡ replace() **does not mutate** the original string. 
>
> replace() returns a **new string**.
>
> replace() replaces only the **first match**.


## Numbers

Numbers in JavaScript can be either **integers** (5) or **floating point numbers** (5.765).

```javascript
// Integer
let number = 45;

// Floating point number
number = 45.124
```
### Special numeric values

Apart from integers and floating point numbers, there are special numeric values in JavaScript:

**Infinity**

```javascript
// We get infinity when we divide a number by 0

1 / 0 // Infinity
```

**NaN (Not a Number)** is a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or undefined mathematical operation:

```javascript
// We cannot divide a string with a number
const age = "5353" / 141;

console.log(age);
```
### Math operators

These are the available math operators in JavaScript:

**Addition _(+)_**

**Subtraction _(-)_**

**Multiplication _(*)_**

**Division (_/_)**

**Remainder (_%_)**

**Exponentiation** _(**)_

Some examples for each operator:

```javascript
// Addition
4 + 2 // = 6

//Subtraction
4 - 2 // = 2

// Multiplication 
4 * 2  // = 8

// Division
4 / 2 // = 2

// Remainder
4 % 2 // = 0

// Exponentiation
4 ** 2 // 16
```


### Converting strings to numbers

parseInt();
parseFloat();

Number();



_We do not use quotation marks when we declare numbers or use them as our value._



## Boolean

The boolean data type can have only two values: **true** or **false**.

```
const loggedIn = true;
const loggedOut = false;
```

The boolean data type can be a **result of a comparison**:

```
const age18 = 18 > 17;
console.log(age18); // true
```

## Null

## Undefined

## Array

## Object

## Dynamic typing in JavaScript

Unlike other programming languages where the variables are bound to a certain data type, in JavaScript, the variables are not bound to a data type, as the data type can change according to the value it is assigned.

This is why we say that JavaScript is a **dynamically typed language**.

```
// First age is declared as a text string
let age = "twenty";
// Then, age is redeclared as a number
age = 20;
```
