As mentioned in the title itself, we will assume that our OS is Ubuntu 22.04.

## Installing PHP

To install PHP, we open the Terminal and install all the newest updates.

We run the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt update

$ sudo apt upgrade
```

Then, to install PHP, we run the command below:

```bash
$ sudo apt install --no-install-recommends php8.1
```

> We need the **--no-install-recommends flag**, so we can install only PHP.

After the installation has finished, we can check whether PHP has been installed successfully by running:

```bash
$ php -v

# We should get a similar output after running the command

PHP 8.1.2-1ubuntu2.11 (cli) (built: Feb 22 2023 22:56:18) (NTS)
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v4.1.2, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
    with Zend OPcache v8.1.2-1ubuntu2.11, Copyright (c), by Zend Technologies
```

## Installing MySQL

Before we install MySQL, we try installing the newest updates again.

We run the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt update

$ sudo apt upgrade
```

Then, we install MySQL by running the command below:

```bash
$ sudo apt install mysql-server
```

To ensure that MySQL is running on our server, we run the following:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start mysql.service

# Then we check the status

$ sudo systemctl status mysql.service

Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mysql.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Wed 2023-06-21 00:39:25 CEST; 3min 7s ago
    Process: 66292 ExecStartPre=/usr/share/mysql/mysql-systemd-start pre (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 66300 (mysqld)
     Status: "Server is operational"
      Tasks: 37 (limit: 18931)
     Memory: 365.3M
        CPU: 883ms
     CGroup: /system.slice/mysql.service
             └─66300 /usr/sbin/mysqld
```

Next, we have to login to MySQL and change the authentication method (password-based) for the root user:

```bash
# When we first run the command, we should not be prompted to enter a password.

$ sudo mysql

$ alter user 'root'@'localhost' identified with mysql_native_password by 'password';

# After executing the command above, we should get this output:

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0,00 sec)

# We exit MySQL

mysql> exit
```

In the next step, we have to run a script that makes sure our installation of MySQL is secure.

```bash
$ mysql_secure_installation

# We are prompted to enter the password we previously entered:

Securing the MySQL server deployment.

Enter password for user root:

# We select yes.

VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT can be used to test passwords
and improve security. It checks the strength of password
and allows the users to set only those passwords which are
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?

Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No:

# We select 0 in this case, but in production we would select 2.

LOW    Length >= 8
MEDIUM Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, and special characters
STRONG Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, special characters and dictionary                  file

Please enter 0 = LOW, 1 = MEDIUM and 2 = STRONG: 0

# We do not change the password we entered for root, so we press any key on the keyboard.

Using existing password for root.

Estimated strength of the password: 50
Change the password for root ? ((Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) :

 ... skipping.

# We select yes.

By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user,
allowing anyone to log into MySQL without having to have
a user account created for them. This is intended only for
testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.
You should remove them before moving into a production
environment.

Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y
Success.

# We select yes again.

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from
'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at
the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y
Success.

# And we select yes again.

Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y
 - Dropping test database...
Success.

 - Removing privileges on test database...
Success.

# Finally, we select yes.

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes
made so far will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y
Success.

All done!
```

Now if we try logging in again like we did at the beginning, we will get an error:

```bash
$ sudo mysql

ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
```

This tells us that we have to log in to our database with a password. So, let's do that:

```bash
# The -u flag is for the user and the -p flag is for password

$ mysql -u root -p

# We enter our password

Enter password:

# We have successfully logged in as root!

### Creating a database

To create a database, we run this command:

```bash
mysql> create table exampleDB;

# Then we check all our databases:

mysql> show schemas;

+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| exampleDB          |
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set (0,00 sec)
```

### Creating a user and granting privileges

To create a user, we run the following command:

```bash
mysql> create user 'andrijan'@'localhost' identified with mysql_native_password by 'password';

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0,01 sec)

# We then use the mysql database:

mysql> use mysql;

Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Database changed

# We show all the users from the user table:

+------------------+
| user             |
+------------------+
| andrijan         |
| debian-sys-maint |
| mysql.infoschema |
| mysql.session    |
| mysql.sys        |
| root             |
+------------------+
6 rows in set (0,00 sec)
```

To grant all privileges to the newly created user on our example database, we can run:

```bash
mysql> grant all on exampleDB.* to 'andrijan'@'localhost';

# Upon a successful granting of privileges, we should get this output:

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0,00 sec)
```
