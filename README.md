### Some other tools that made my work easier

## What I learned

- How to use TypeScript with Astro. Although it must be mentioned that some of the types they provide can be confusing at times.
- How to apply dark mode on a statically generated site with React. The dark mode implemented respects the user's system preference. If the user has no preference, light mode is applied. Also, the preference or choice is saved in local storage so that on a reload, the preferred mode is applied.
- How to use a syntax highlighter and adjust it to light and dark mode.
- What MDX is and how to use it with Astro and React.
